# ICU Heart Failure Mortality Prediction

## Project Overview

This project is a supervised machine learning endeavor that focuses on predicting the mortality of ICU patients with heart failure. It utilizes a dataset containing patient vital signs and lab results, and more to develop predictive models. The primary goal is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients who are more likely to experience adverse outcomes during their ICU stay.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: I employed advanced machine learning techniques to predict patient mortality, providing data-driven insights to aid medical decision-making.

## Core Functionalities

- **Data Analysis**: I performed thorough data analysis to understand the patterns and relationships within the dataset.

- **Model Development**: I designed, trained, and evaluated machine learning models capable of predicting patient outcomes.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The project is primarily built using Python, a versatile and powerful programming language.

- **Machine Learning Libraries**: I leveraged machine learning library Scikit-Learn to develop and deploy predictive models.

## Lessons Learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in several areas:

- **Python Programming**: I improved my Python coding skills, becoming proficient in data manipulation and analysis.

- **Algorithm Development**: I developed and fine-tuned algorithms for predictive modeling, enhancing our problem-solving abilities.
